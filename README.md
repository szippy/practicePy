# practicePy
A place for practice problems in python to help me improve, but not important enough for their own repository 

I'll be starting with a few practice problems from: https://www.practicepython.org/ 

I might work on project Euler programs after I'm out of interesting ones from practicepython.org

Eventually I'd like to create a launcher for the different programs, but that's not for sure. 

Maybe some Bash.
